Sediment core id, WGZ-GC-1
latitude,-84.3352938247
longitude,-163.612566317
note, Values in column i for i>1 represent grain size fraction with diameter between heading(i) and heading(i-1). Values in column 1 represent grain size fraction with diameter less than heading(1). Grain size fractions are reliable for grain size diameters <=1mm. for grain size diameters >1mm, please reference data in WGZ-GC1_TC_GS.csv

heading(0), sample distance from core top (cm)
heading(1:), upper bound on grain diameter (10^-6 m)
